Developers

*Rateslib* is a project designed for Python built with Python and Rust.
To actively develop it and submit pull requests (PRs) to the repo you will need
to set up a development environment.

**1) Get the files**

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.

.. code-block::

   />$ git clone https://github.com/attack68/rateslib.git
   />$ cd rateslib

**2) Setup Python and Rust**

It is recommended to **install Python 3.13 and Rust 1.80**.

Create and activate a virtual Python environment, as below
(or the equivalent for Windows).

.. code-block::

   rateslib/>$ python3 -m venv venv
   rateslib/>$ source ./venv/bin/activate

**3) Install development requirements**

Install the package dependencies for development and
then install *rateslib* locally in editable mode.

.. code-block::

   (venv) rateslib/>$ pip install -r requirement.txt
   (venv) rateslib/>$ pip install -e .

**4) Test your environment**

After installing everything test that everything is successful.

.. code-block::

   (venv) rateslib/>$ pytest

**5) Making changes**

You can now edit and make code changes and submit them for addition to
the package. The continuous integration (CI) checks on github perform 8 tasks:

- **Rust Checks**

  If you do not make changes to the *Rust* section of the code these will remain
  unaffected. If you do it will run:

  - ``cargo fmt --check``: to ensure that rust code is properly formatted. If you
    need to make auto-formatting changes then run the following before committing:

    .. code-block::

       (venv) rateslib/>$ cargo fmt

  - ``cargo test --lib``: to ensure that any introduced code does not impact the
    pre-existing unit tests for the existing codebase. To check this before
    committing run:

    .. code-block::

      (venv) rateslib/>$ cargo test --lib

  - ``cargo test --doc``: to ensure that any introduced code does not impact the
    pre-existing tests in the rust documentation. To check this before
    committing run:

    .. code-block::

      (venv) rateslib/>$ cargo test --doc

  If you made changes to the *Rust* section then you must rebuild the PyO3 extension
  module before testing it works in Python. To do this run:

  .. code-block::

     (venv) rateslib/>$ maturin develop --release

- **Python Checks**

  If you make changes to the Python section of the code it will run:

  - ``ruff check``: to ensure that no styling or linting errors have been introduced.
    You may be able to auto-fix any of these before committing by using:

    .. code-block::

       (venv) rateslib/>$ ruff check --fix

  - ``ruff format``: to ensure that the Python code is correctly formatted. If the CI
    reports errors you can auto-format your code by locally running:

    .. code-block::

       (venv) rateslib/>$ ruff format

  - ``mypy``: type checking the Python code to ensure type consistency. You should locally
    run the following and fix any issues before committing (note ensure you are using the
    latest supported Python and mypy versions, inline with the github server):

    .. code-block::

       (venv) rateslib/>$ mypy

  - ``coverage run -m pytest``: this runs all the pytests and measures the coverage
    report of the codebase which should remain > 96%. You can this locally also
    before committing by using:

    .. code-block::

       (venv) rateslib/>$ coverage run -m pytest

- **Building Documentation**

  The documentation is built with *Sphinx* and its extensions. To locally build
  the documentation to debug or visualise any changes before submission, run:

  .. code-block::

   (venv) rateslib/>$ cd docs
   (venv)     docs/>$ make clean
   (venv)     docs/>$ make html

  In order to build docs without error you will also need to **install pandoc**.

  In order to generate inheritance diagrams you will need to **install graphviz**.

Development Plan
********************

In no particular order...

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - Rust extension
     - Continue to port classes to Rust with PyO3 extension module, also simultaneously
       working towards stabilising a standalone crate for Rust for linear fixed income.
   * - Swaptions
     - Plan the design architecture and implementation for  *Swaptions* and *IRVolCube*
   * - Credit Default Swaps
     - Add a *CDS* *Instrument* and also think about *Curve* transformation methods for analysis
       between credit discount curves and hazard rates / survival curves.
   * - Specifications for standard products
     - Extend the ``spec`` loader to cover wider range of *Instruments* particularly with respect
       to *Bond* calculations.
   * - Documentation
     - Broaden the array of available tutorials, especially in regards to *Bond* analysis,
       credit analysis and *Index* analysis.
   * - PnL Monitoring
     - Provide an automated PnL explain from multiple *Solvers* (i.e "open" and "close")
   * - Serialisation
     - Continue to enhance the *Serialisation* aspect of objects. This feature will naturally
       develop with the Rust extension since stronger typing provides a much more rigid framework
       for data manipulation.
   * - Interactivity
     - Expand the available tutorials for interactivity, such as using Excel, Jupyterlite, or
       app packages, such as *Streamlit*, *Dash*, *Panel*.
   * - Documentation
     - Release v2 of "Coding Interest Rates" which contains all of the mathematics and architecture
       changes since version 1.0.0.
