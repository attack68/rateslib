Purchasing Licence Extensions
*******************************

Licensing enquiries typically fall into two categories;

- Few or single users.
- Enterprise style.

Per User Based - £244 per/yr
------------------------------

The cost of a single user licence is currently £244 per user/per year (approx $300),
with the annual period running from date of purchase, with price guarantees
indexed by inflation.

Users are most often individuals, but not necessarily. The definition of a user,
found in the licence terms: :ref:`here <licence-user>`, can include servers, depending upon
corporate structure and intended use.

For a single user (or small numbers), who is expected to use the *rateslib* package as-is
and to benefit from upcoming new releases, this is the most efficient way to handle
licences.

      for a set number of users, or, alternatively,
      you can pay by credit card specifying the desired number of users.

Annual licences are non-refundable and are not measured pro-rata. However, in the event of
employee changes they are fully transferable.

Enterprise Style
-----------------

   <p>Enterprise style licences can be agreed upon request. Please contact:
      <span style="color:black; font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">info@r<span class="spamoff">Stockholm Kungsgatan</span>ateslib.com</span>
   </p>

For multiple users this is the most efficient, and cheaper licensing option and it allows for bespoke
discussion regarding whether *rateslib* will be used in its packaged form, or if its code
is to be used as a component of an internal library and internally modified and extended.
