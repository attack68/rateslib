****************************
Serialization
****************************

*Rateslib* is an object oriented library requiring dynamic associations to
create pricing and risk functionality. The objective of serialization and
deserialization is to convert *rateslib's* objects into a form that
can be persisted or transported, with a view towards being able to recapture
those dynamic associations.

Ultimately this means that data could be stored in a database and retrieved,
or it could be transmitted over the web from a server to a client based browser and
reconstructed.

.. warning::

   This feature is currently experimental, and in development.

JSON
*******

Serialization is a general term. The specific form of serialization that *rateslib*
aims to create is JSON serialization, meaning an object can be deconstructed
into a JSON string and reconstructed from the same string. JSON has pros and cons
associated with its choice. A con being that it is not necessarily the most
efficient form of transfer or storage, but pros being that is is human-readable,
transparent and provides a defined data structure.

The key method used for this purpose is:

Objects in Scope
******************

Dual
------

The automatic differentiation (AD) data types (:class:`~rateslib.dual.Dual` and :class:`~rateslib.dual.Dual2`)
are fundamental data types. These must be serializable to propagate the attribute of serialization to other
objects.

.. ipython:: python

   dual = Dual(3.141, ["x", "y"], [1.0, 0.0])
   dual.to_json()
   from_json(dual.to_json())

.. ipython:: python

   dual2 = Dual2(3.141, ["x", "y"], [1.0, 0.0], [])
   dual2.to_json()
   from_json(dual2.to_json())

Calendars
-----------

Calendar serialization is useful for saving and loading custom calendar objects.

.. ipython:: python

   # create a `Cal` with two holidays and general weekends
   cal = Cal([dt(2023, 1, 2), dt(2023, 1, 3)], [5,6])
   cal.to_json()

   # create an identical calendar to `cal` (in business day terms), by unionising calendars
   union_cal = UnionCal([Cal([dt(2023, 1, 2)], [5,6]), Cal([dt(2023, 1, 3)], [])])
   union_cal.to_json()

   # these two objects have the same business and settlement days..
   from_json(cal.to_json()) == from_json(union_cal.to_json())

   # serializing NamedCal remains consistent to the pre-compiled calendars for the version of rateslib
   named_cal = NamedCal("tgt")
   named_cal.to_json()

PPSplines
---------

*PPSpline* serialization is added as a pre-requisite to add *Curve* serialization.

.. ipython:: python

   pps = PPSplineF64(k=4, t=[0,0,0,0,4,4,4,4], c=None)
   pps.csolve(np.array([0, 1, 3, 4]), np.array([0, 0, 2, 2]), 0, 0, False)
   pps.to_json()

   from_json(pps.to_json())


FXRates
--------

.. ipython:: python

   fxr = FXRates({"gbpusd": 1.2959, "eurusd": 1.0894}, settlement=dt(2024, 7, 16))
   fxr.to_json()

   fxr.rate("gbpeur")
   from_json(fxr.to_json()).rate("gbpeur")
