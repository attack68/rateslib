Release Notes
**************

The future development of *rateslib* is open to many avenues.
Some possibilities are listed below. The author is very interested in any feedback
and this can be given on the public **Issues** board at the project github
repository: `Rateslib Project <https://github.com/attack68/rateslib>`_, or by direct
email contact through **rateslib@gmail.com**.

1.3.0 (Not released)
***********************

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - Calendars
     - The `pandas` holiday and calendar system has been removed in favour of a rust implementation for
       calendar objects: :class:`~rateslib.calendars.Cal` and :class:`~rateslib.calendars.UnionCal`.
   * - Calendars
     - :red:`Breaking Change!` The :meth:`~rateslib.calendars.create_calendar` methods is deprecated and
       modified to accept different input arguments.
   * - Calendars
     - The tokyo calendar *'tyo'* has been added to align with TONA publication.
   * - Bug
     - :class:`~rateslib.instruments.ZCS` now raises if fixed frequency is given as "Z".
   * - Bug
     - :meth:`~rateslib.instruments.FixedRateBond.rate` method of a *FixedRateBond* now correctly
       returns the local currency price or yield-to-maturity without being wrongly converted by a
       ``base`` FX rate, if an FX object is also supplied to the pricing formula.

1.2.2 (31st May 2024)
**********************

This version uses **Rust** bindings. See :ref:`getting started <pricing-doc>`
for notes about installation changes.

New *FX Volatility Products* are set to **beta** status, probably until version 2.0.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - Performance
     - The modules ``rateslib.dual`` and ``rateslib.splines`` have been ported to **Rust**
       instead of Python to improve calculation times.
   * - Splines
     - New methods :meth:`~rateslib.splines.PPSplineF64.ppev_single_dual`,
       :meth:`~rateslib.splines.PPSplineF64.ppev_single_dual2`,
       :meth:`~rateslib.splines.PPSplineF64.ppdnev_single_dual`,
       and :meth:`~rateslib.splines.PPSplineF64.ppdnev_single_dual2` have been added to
       ensure correct handling of AD with regards to both x-axis and y-axis variables. See
       :ref:`section on using AD with splines <splines-ad-doc>`
   * - Splines
     - Added :meth:`~rateslib.splines.evaluate` for automatically handling which *ppdnev* method
       to use based on the AD sensitivities of the given `x` value.
   * - Instruments
     - :red:`Breaking Changes!` Amend :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXExchange` to **remove** the
       arguments ``currency`` and ``leg2_currency``
       in favour of using ``pair`` which is consistent with the new *FX Volatility* naming convention.
       Also **reverse** the ``notional`` so that a +1mm EURUSD transaction is considered as a purchase of
       EUR and a sale of USD.
   * - Instruments
     - :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXSwap` allows the dominant ``pair`` argument, consistent with other *FX*
       instruments to define the currencies. ``currency`` and ``leg2_currency`` are still currently permissible if
       ``pair`` is omitted.
   * - Instruments
     - Basic *FX Volatility Instruments* have been added in **beta** status, including
       :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXCall`, :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXPut`,
       :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXRiskReversal`, :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXStraddle`,
       :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXStrangle`, :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXBrokerFly`
       and :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXOptionStrat`.
       See :ref:`user guide section <fx-volatility-doc>` for more information.
   * - FX Volatility
     - New pricing components :class:`~rateslib.fx_volatility.FXDeltaVolSmile` and
       :class:`~rateslib.fx_volatility.FXDeltaVolSurface`
       have been added
       to allow pricing of single expiry *FX Options* with a *Smile* interpolated over a *Delta*
       axis. See :ref:`FX volatility construction <c-fx-smile-doc>`.
   * - AD
     - Added :meth:`~rateslib.dual.dual_norm_pdf` for AD safe standard normal probability density.
   * - AD
     - Added :meth:`~rateslib.solver.newton_1dim` and :meth:`~rateslib.solver.newton_ndim`
       for AD safe Newton root solving in one or multiple dimensions.
   * - Solver
     - Added :meth:`~rateslib.solver.quadratic_eqn` to return the solution of a quadratic equation
       in an AD safe and consistent return format to other solvers for convenience.
   * - Bug
     - "ActActICMA" convention now handles ``frequency`` of "Z", asserting that of "A",
       albeit with a *UserWarning*.
   * - Bug
     - ``npv`` and ``cashflows`` of a :class:`~rateslib.periods.FloatPeriod` did not
       handle error messages regarding missing RFR fixings for a historical period.
       Calculations wll now raise if missing ``fixings``.
   * - Bug
     - `FXSwap` now no longer raises `TypeError` for dual number type mixing when `npv` or `rate`
       are called after changing the AD order of curves and fx objects.


1.1.0 (20th Mar 2024)
**********************

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - Automatic Differentiation
     - :red:`Breaking Change!` Dual number `gradient` method is no longer calculable on the object.
       Instead of `dual.gradient(vars)` use the following call `gradient(dual, vars)`, using the
       provided function :meth:`rateslib.dual.gradient`.
   * - Instruments
     - Added argument ``metric`` to :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Value` so that specific *Curve* values derived
       as calculated figures (e.g. continuously compounded zero rate, or index value) can be calibrated by *Solvers*.
   * - Bug
     - :meth:`~rateslib.solver.Solver.delta` and :meth:`~rateslib.solver.Solver.gamma` now work directly with
       given ``npv`` when ``fx`` is not provided.
   * - Bug
     - :meth:`~rateslib.periods.FloatPeriod.npv` now returns 0.0 for historical payment dates correctly when
       given the ``local`` argument.
   * - Bug
     - :meth:`~rateslib.periods.IndexCashflow.cashflows` no longer prints dual numbers to tables.
   * - Performance
     - Curve iterations in the :class:`~rateslib.solver.Solver` were amended in the way they handle
       :class:`~rateslib.dual.Dual` variables in order to reduce upcasting and increase the speed of basic operations.
   * - Performance
     - :class:`~rateslib.splines.bsplev_single` introduced a short circuit based on the positivity and support
       property to greatly improve time needed to solve curves with splines.
   * - Performance
     - :class:`~rateslib.curves.Curve` with splines are remapped to use float posix timestamps rather than datetimes
       for building splines. Operations with floats are much faster than their equivalents using timedeltas.

       and determine the rest from a *Series*. Also allow ``fx_fixings`` as a 2-tuple for similar
       reason for MTM *XCS*.
   * - Instruments
     - :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Fly` and :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Spread` now express
       *rate* in basis point terms and not percent.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature

   * - Bug
     - The :meth:`~rateslib.instruments.Portfolio.npv` method on a *Portfolio* no longer allows
       mixed currency outputs to be aggregated into a single float value.
   * - Bug

       to :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FloatRateNote` and removed the
       alias :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Swap`.
   * - Instruments
     - Add a ``spec`` keyword argument to allow instruments to be pre-defined and follow
       market conventions without the user needing to input these directly, but preserving an
       ability to overwrite specific values.

       determining the rate.
   * - Curves
     - The :meth:`shift()<rateslib.curves.Curve.shift>` operation for *Curves* now defaults to using
       a *CompositeCurve* approach to preserve a constant spread to the underlying *Curve* via
       a dynamic association. Shifted curves can also optionally add ``id`` and ``collateral``
       tags.
   * - Schedule
     - A :class:`~rateslib.scheduling.Schedule` now has the arguments ``eval_date`` and
       ``eval_mode`` allow a tenor-tenor effective-termination input.
   * - Defaults
     - Change the default :class:`~rateslib.solver.Solver` algorithm to *"levenberg_marquardt"*
       because it is more robust for new users, even if slower in general.
   * - Bug
     - :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXExchange` can now be imported from *rateslib* and has been added
       to ``__init__``.

     - Added :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXExchange`, to provide booking FX spot or FX forward
       trades.
   * - Legs
     - Removed all ``LegExchange`` types, and replaced by adding ``initial_exchange`` and
       ``final_exchange`` as arguments to basic ``Legs``.
   * - Instruments
     - The ``payment_lag_exchange`` parameter for ``FXSwap`` was removed in favour of using
       ``payment_lag``.
   * - Defaults
     - Added historic fixing data until end July for ESTR, SOFR,
       SWESTR, SONIA and NOWA, for testing and validation.
   * - Instruments
     - Collateral tags were added to *Curves* to permit the new method ``cashflows_table`` which
       tabulates future cashflows according to currency and collateral type.
   * - Performance
     - Calendars are now cached which improves general performance by about 10%.
   * - Bug
     - When performing operations on *CompositeCurves* the resultant curve now correctly inherits
       the ``multi_csa`` parameters.
   * - Bug
     - ``FloatPeriod`` fixing exposure tables were marginally overestimated by ignoring
       discounting effects. This is corrected.
   * - Bug
     - NumPy.float128 datatype is not available on Windows and caused loading errors.
   * - Bug
     - The holiday calendars: 'ldn', 'tgt', 'nyc', 'stk', 'osl', and 'zur', have been reviewed
       and validated historic fixings against the historic fixing data. These are also now
       fully documented.
