Rough Development Plan
***********************

The future development of *rateslib* is open to many avenues.
Some possibilities are listed below. The author is very interested in any feedback
and this can be given on the public **Issues** board at the project github
repository: `Rateslib Project <https://github.com/attack68/rateslib>`_, or by direct
email contact through **rateslib@gmail.com**.

   :header-rows: 1


   * - Feature
     - Description
     - Consideration
     - Timeframe
   * - Vanilla FX options and volatility products
     - Adding option instruments and benchmark trades such as risk-reversals.
     - Highly likely (v2.0?)
     - By mid 2024
   * - Vanilla Swaptions
     - Adding the instruments priced by a volatility input.
     - Likely (v2.0 or v3.0?)
     - By end 2024
   * - SABR model for options
     - Adding the parameters to construct SABR vol surfaces/ cuves.
     - Possible, with dependencies to other developments. (v3.0?)
     - By end 2024
   * - Optimization of code
     - Using C extensions, or rust, or re-writing certain blocks to improve performance.
     - Likely to some degree, depending upon community adoption and contributions.
     - no ETA
   * - AD backend
     - Changing the AD implementation to another 3rd party (JAX, PyAudi)
     - Very unlikely, maturity of those libraries must increase and the performance
       improvements must be sufficient to warrant such a large codebase change.
     - no ETA


1.1.0 (Not released)
**********************

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - Automatic Differentiation
     - :red:`Breaking Change!` Dual number `gradient` method is no longer calculable on the object.
       Instead of `dual.gradient(vars)` use the following call `gradient(dual, vars)`, using the
       provided function :meth:`rateslib.dual.gradient`.
   * - Instruments
     - Added argument ``metric`` to :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Value` so that specific *Curve* values derived
       as calculated figures (e.g. continuously compounded zero rate, or index value) can be calibrated by *Solvers*.
   * - Bug
     - `Solver.delta` and `Solver.gamma` now work directly with given ``npv`` when ``fx`` is not provided.
   * - Performance
     - Curve iterations in the :class:`~rateslib.solver.Solver` were amended in the way they handle
       :class:`~rateslib.dual.Dual` variables in order to reduce upcasting and increase the speed of basic operations.

   * - Legs
     - Allow ``fixings`` as a 2-tuple to manually define the first *FloatPeriod* (say as IBOR stub)
       and determine the rest from a *Series*. Also allow ``fx_fixings`` as a 2-tuple for similar
       reason for MTM *XCS*.
   * - Instruments
     - :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Fly` and :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Spread` now express
       *rate* in basis point terms and not percent.

   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description

     - Instrument ``spec`` with ``method_param`` set to 2 day lag for certain IBOR instruments.
   * - Bug
     - The :meth:`~rateslib.instruments.Portfolio.npv` method on a *Portfolio* no longer allows
       mixed currency outputs to be aggregated into a single float value.
   * - Bug
     - Now emit a warning if a discount factor or rate is requested on a curve with a spline
       outside of the rightmost boundary of the spline interval.


0.5.1 (11 Sep 2023)
**********************

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Description
   * - Instruments
     - Rename :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FloatRateBond`
       to :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FloatRateNote` and removed the
       alias :class:`~rateslib.instruments.Swap`.
   * - Instruments
     - Add a ``spec`` keyword argument to allow instruments to be pre-defined and follow
       market conventions without the user needing to input these directly, but preserving an
       ability to overwrite specific values.
   * - Instruments
     - Add ``calc_mode`` to *Bonds* to provide mechanisms to perform YTM calculations under
       different conventions and geographies.
   * - Periods
     - :class:`~rateslib.periods.FloatPeriod` now allows **averaging** methods for
       determining the rate.
   * - Curves
     - The :meth:`shift()<rateslib.curves.Curve.shift>` operation for *Curves* now defaults to using
       a *CompositeCurve* approach to preserve a constant spread to the underlying *Curve* via
       a dynamic association. Shifted curves can also optionally add ``id`` and ``collateral``
       tags.
   * - Schedule
     - A :class:`~rateslib.scheduling.Schedule` now has the arguments ``eval_date`` and
       ``eval_mode`` allow a tenor-tenor effective-termination input.
   * - Defaults
     - Change the default :class:`~rateslib.solver.Solver` algorithm to *"levenberg_marquardt"*
       because it is more robust for new users, even if slower in general.
   * - Bug
     - :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXExchange` can now be imported from *rateslib* and has been added
       to ``__init__``.
   * - Bug
     - :meth:`~rateslib.instruments.Sensitivities.cashflows_table` no longer returns empty when
       no collateral information is available.
   * - Bug
     - :meth:`~rateslib.periods.FloatPeriod.fixings_table` now properly represents published
       fixing values as having zero nominal exposure.
   * - Bug
     - ``solver.fx`` attribute is now properly passed through to the ``rate`` calculation
       of multi-currency instruments when ``fx`` is *None*.

********************

.. list-table::
   :widths: 25 75
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature

     - Added ``split_notional`` to :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXSwap` to more accurately
       reflect the interbank traded product.
   * - Instruments
     - Added :class:`~rateslib.instruments.FXExchange`, to provide booking FX spot or FX forward
       trades.
   * - Legs
     - Removed all ``LegExchange`` types, and replaced by adding ``initial_exchange`` and
       ``final_exchange`` as arguments to basic ``Legs``.
   * - Instruments
     - The ``payment_lag_exchange`` parameter for ``FXSwap`` was removed in favour of using
       ``payment_lag``.
   * - Defaults
     - Added historic fixing data until end July for ESTR, SOFR,
       SWESTR, SONIA and NOWA, for testing and validation.
   * - Instruments
     - Collateral tags were added to *Curves* to permit the new method ``cashflows_table`` which
       tabulates future cashflows according to currency and collateral type.
   * - Performance
     - Calendars are now cached which improves general performance by about 10%.
   * - Bug
     - When performing operations on *CompositeCurves* the resultant curve now correctly inherits
       the ``multi_csa`` parameters.
   * - Bug
     - ``FloatPeriod`` fixing exposure tables were marginally overestimated by ignoring
       discounting effects. This is corrected.
   * - Bug
     - NumPy.float128 datatype is not available on Windows and caused loading errors.
   * - Bug
     - The holiday calendars: 'ldn', 'tgt', 'nyc', 'stk', 'osl', and 'zur', have been reviewed
       and validated historic fixings against the historic fixing data. These are also now
       fully documented.
   * - Bug
     - *CompositeCurve* can now be constructed from *ProxyCurve* and *Curve* combinations.
