Dual.__doc__ = """
Dual number data type to perform first derivative automatic differentiation.

Parameters
----------
real : float
   The real coefficient of the dual number: its value.
vars : tuple/list of str
   The labels of the variables for which to record derivatives. If empty,
   the dual number represents a constant, equivalent to a float.
dual : list of float
   First derivative information contained as coefficient of linear manifold.
   Defaults to an array of ones the length of ``vars`` if empty.

Dual2.__doc__ = """
Dual number data type to perform second derivative automatic differentiation.

Parameters
-----------
real : float
   The real coefficient of the dual number: its value.
vars : tuple/list of str
   The labels of the variables for which to record derivatives. If empty,
   the dual number represents a constant, equivalent to a float.
dual : list of float
   First derivative information contained as coefficient of linear manifold.
   Defaults to an array of ones the length of ``vars`` if empty.
dual2 : list of float
   Second derivative information contained as coefficients of quadratic manifold.
   Defaults to a 2d array of zeros the size of ``vars`` if empty.
   These values represent a 2d array but must be given as a 1d list of values in row-major order,
   which is reshaped.
