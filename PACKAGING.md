For preparing a new release:

On "main":

1) Update the whatsnew with the target release date.
2) Add a new entry to the switcher.json in main:docs/source/static, pushing stable to next version.
3) Change the badges.json file is there is anything to add, e.g. versions.
4) Bump the "version" in pyproject.toml, and __init__ __version__ and check the dependencies.
5) Checks should be OK in github actions but perform a local double check.

Checks:
$ coverage run -m pytest
Perform this on development environment as well as specified minimum.
$ pytest -W error
Checking for uncaptured warnings.

6) Add to the MANIFEST.in file if anything needs including
7) Commit and push any changes - this will temporarily break readthedocs which will build from push.
8) Create a new release branch, e.g. '0.3.x' and checkout

On "release branch":

1) Update the "release" field in docs/source/conf.py, e.g. to '0.3.x'
2) Delete the switcher in the releases branch since this is taken from main branch
3) Build the INSTRUMENT_SPEC from the loader file and print the dict. Paste to file and set
   DEVELOPMENT to False.

4) Commit and Push the branch.
5) Run `cargo test --lib --no-default-features`
6) Change the Cargo.toml file for abi3-py39 features.

Build:
$ pip install build twine
$ python -m build
$ twine check dist/*
$ twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
$ twine upload dist/*  [use __token__ as username and token is in env file]

check:
$ pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple rateslib

In Read-the-Docs admin console:

1) Add a new branch for auto built docs.
2) Checkout the "stable" tagging branch and update to the new version and force push. 

In GITHUB:

1) Add a new release.
2) Update the Repo PNG with the new badges.
